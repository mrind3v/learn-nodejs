# Steps to do CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) Operations on MongoDb

1. Connect to mongoDb server using mongoose (either it's running locally or in cloud)
2. Create schema (how one entity in our collection looks like)
   (note-> in NoSQL Dbs, documents/collections are equivalent to tables)
3. Create a "Model" from the schema
4. Do CRUD operations on that model
